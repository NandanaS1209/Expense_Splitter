# Expense_Splitter
Java console app for splitting group expenses with MySQL. Add users, log shared expenses, and view net settlementsâ€”only the minimum required payment between users is shown. Demonstrates OOP, JDBC, and optimized debt netting.
## Features
- **Add Users:** Register group members for expense tracking.
- **Log Expenses:** Record who paid and who participated.
- **Optimized Settlements:** Nets out mutual debts so only the minimum required payments are shown.
- **Persistent Storage:** All data stored in MySQL.
- **Interactive CLI:** User-friendly menu for all actions.
## How It Works
- Each expense is split equally among selected participants.
- The app calculates all debts, then nets out mutual debts between users to minimize the number of transactions.
- All data is persisted in MySQL, demonstrating real-world backend integration.
## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
2. **Set up the MySQL database:**
- Create a database named `expensesplitter`.
- Run the following SQL to set up tables:
  ```
  CREATE TABLE users (
    id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
  );
  CREATE TABLE expenses (
    id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    paid_by VARCHAR(36)
  );
  ```
3. **Update database credentials:**
- In `ExpenseSplitterApp.java`, set your MySQL username and password.
4. **Run the application:**
- Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred Java IDE.
- Run `ExpenseSplitterApp.java`.
- Use the menu to add users, expenses, and view settlements.
